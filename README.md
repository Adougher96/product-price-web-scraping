# Product Price Web Scraping

## Overview
This project scrapes product data (title, price, and rating) from the website **Books to Scrape** using Python. After scraping, the data is cleaned and analyzed to explore relationships between product price and rating.

## Tools Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Workflow
1. Scrape product names, prices, and ratings from the homepage
2. Convert the rating text into numerical values
3. Store data in a CSV
4. Visualize price distribution, ratings distribution, and price by rating

## Key Findings
- The average product price was calculated
- Most books are rated 3–4 stars
- There is no clear trend that higher-rated books are more expensive

## Files in this Repo
- `product_scraper.py`: Python script used for scraping and analysis
- `Product Price Web Scraping Analysis.docx`: Documentation of project steps and findings

## Note
Due to limited data from the homepage only, this is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating full workflow: scraping → cleaning → analysis → visualization.
